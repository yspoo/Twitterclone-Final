<!-- render seperate nav bars depending on if the user is signed in or not. -->
<!-- Navigation bar is split into erb partials, one for users, one for guests. -->

<% if !user_signed_in? %>
<!-- user_signed_in is a built in method provided by Devise that returns if a user is signed in or not, the bang sign is Ruby variation of a negation: so it is saying if user is not signed in. -->
  <%= render '/layouts/nav_guest' %>
<% else %>
  <%= render '/layouts/nav_user' %>
<% end %>
<!-- rmb that the path has to be:
  '/layouts/nav_user'
  '/layouts/nav_guest'
if just write '/nav_guest' or '/nav_user', the path is incomplete. there has to be a directory stated in front of the file even if the files belong to the same directory. rmb to add a forward slash '/' because we are using relative path.

also rmb to use "<%=" with an equal sign "=" so that we are rendering the view!

=begin
By default, Rails will act like:
  has_many :followed, through: :active_relationships
  has_many :follower, through: :passive_relationships
=> Rails will have a default source. In this case, the source is the column name that we specified in Relationship model, which is "followed". However, if we change "followed" to "banana", then the source also changes to "banana".

However, if we prefer to have our own naming, we can write it like:
  has_many :following, through: :active_relationships, source: :followed
  has_many :follower, through: :passive_relationships, source: :followed
=> Now, we can use <user>.following to find all the people that <user> followed. We have to specify the "source" to the column we are linking to. So if "followed" was changed to "banana", then the source also changes to "banana".

 "following" and "followers" can be any names I want.
 It is just a naming convention for a helper method so that we can use:
  <user>.following to find all the people that <user> followed.
  <user>.followers to find all the people that follows <user>.
